## Local preview

_NOTE_: Feel free to replace `http://localhost:1313` with desired IP address
and port.

## Good practices

### Broken links checker

Currently we are using [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) a fast,
async, stream-based link checker written in Rust. The automatic check is
triggered on each push to the master pull request.

You can also run it locally using a docker image:

```bash
$ docker run --init -it --rm -w $(pwd) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) lycheeverse/lychee
    --max-redirects 10 -a 403,429,500,502,503,999 .
```

### Relative links

Please avoid using relative like:

```md
[contact](../../pages/contact/)
```

Instead, use absolute links:

```md
[contact](https://www.dasharo.com/pages/contact/)
```

### pre-commit hooks

- [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#install), if you
  followed [local build](#local-preview) procedure `pre-commit` should be
  installed

- [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

- Install hooks into repo:

```shell
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

- Enjoy automatic checks on each `git commit` action!

- (Optional) Run hooks on all files (for example, when adding new hooks or
  configuring existing ones):

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### To skip verification

In some cases, it may be needed to skip `pre-commit` tests. To do that, please
use:

```shell
git commit --no-verify
```
